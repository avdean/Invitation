         Almost six years to be precise, Ant met a very special person during his adventures and travels. His soulmate turned out to be a Spanish girl called Miry, whom he met while working on a cruise ship in Caribbean waters!<br><br>Through the ups and downs that life throws at people, the pair discovered that together they could handle whatever came their way. Long story short, Anthony proposed to Miry and the good news is she said yes! Of course, with a wedding on the way, there's still many people that she needs to meet and we'd like you to be one of them!

          Intrepid Travel Companions</h1>
          <p class="content is-size-7">
         Kayleigh and Dan met each other like many other millennials- through Tinder! And it was a success 
story, after their first date where Dan had to cut Kayleigh’s pizza, (there were no scissors to hand!) 
they hit it off straight away and have been together for over 4 and half years. <br><br>
Last year they decided to buy a one-way ticket to Thailand and travel South East Asia - no plans, no 
destination in mind, just the one-way ticket and make up the plan as they went along. After some 
horrendously long bus and car journeys (designed for people half Dan’s height), getting lost in 
jungles after sunset and boycotting our hotel room because of bed bugs, we loved every minute of it 
and enjoyed spending time together even though it was 24/7.<br><br>
After realising that they could spend that much time together without killing each other, to 
Kayleigh’s surprise, Dan popped the question on his birthday in their favourite city, Penang, her 
first response was “Holy Fuck Balls!” and then she said yes. 
Again, many of you are still yet to meet Dan so please let us know if you can attend and join us for a 
few drinks!
